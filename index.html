              I am currently a Software Developer at KoaliTime, a startup
              focused on helping parents manage their children's screen time.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>My Journey</h4>
            <p>
              My story is unique. I grew up in Bnei Brak, the eldest of eight
              children in a Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) family. My late father was a
              full-time Talmud scholar, while my mother works as a teacher for
              children with special needs. From a young age, I questioned the
              Haredi education I received. At 15, I found the courage to explore
              beyond my community and moved in with non-orthodox relatives.
              Leaving the Haredi community meant I had no basic knowledge in
              mathematics or English. I didn't even know the ABCs, and my
              arithmetic knowledge was limited to multiplication tables.
              Unfamiliar with most core subjects, I was determined to bridge the
              gap and pursued the Bagrut (Israeli SATs). I enrolled in an
              external school and later completed most of the Bagrut
              qualifications while also studying fitness training at the Wingate
              Institute.
            </p>
            <p>
              At 18, I lived with relatives who took me in. Like many youths in
              their area, I attended a pre-military academy called Emek
              HaMaayanot near Beit She'an. There, we immersed ourselves in
              contemporary spiritual philosophy and Zionism, preparing
              physically and mentally for military service. Despite initially
              being refused by the IDF due to a low medical profile, I
              volunteered for national service after several unsuccessful
              appeals. In the first year, I served at Jordan River Village, and
              in the second, with Magen David Adom (MDA).
            </p>
            <p>
              After my service, I completed my matriculation exams and worked as
              a paramedic. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, I found myself
              with an abundance of free time. Eager to learn, I enrolled in an
              online programming course. My interest in programming and
              computing grew rapidly, leading me to pursue a degree in Computer
              Science at Reichman University.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my degree I joined KoaliTime, where we help parents monitor
              and manage their children's usage of mobile apps. Our goal is to
              ensure quality time and promote the use of skill-building apps.
