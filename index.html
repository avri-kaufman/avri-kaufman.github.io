                        scholarship track. I currently work as a Software Developer at 'KoaliTime' startup.
                        I live in Tel Aviv with my newlywed wife, Rotem, and our adorable cat,
                        Ray.
                    </p>
                    <p>My story is unique.
                        I grew up in Bnei Brak in a family of eight, with me being the eldest
                        child. My late father was a full-time Talmud scholar (Avrech), while my
                        mother works as a teacher in a school for children with special needs.
                        From a young age, I had questions and doubts about the Haredi
                        (ultra-Orthodox) education I received. At 15, I gathered the courage to
                        explore further and left home to live with non-orthodox relatives for
                        several years. Departing the Haredi community, I had no basic knowledge
                        in mathematics or English. I didn't even know the ABCs,
                        and my arithmetic knowledge was limited to multiplication tables.
                        I was unfamiliar with most core subjects. Determined to bridge the gap,
                        I pursued the Bagrut (Israeli SATs). I enrolled in an external school
                        and later completed most of the Bagrut qualifications. Concurrently,
                        I studied at the <a href="https://wingate.org.il/" class="outside-link" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Wingate
                            Institute</a>
                        for a fitness training course.
                    </p>
                    <p>At 18, I lived with relatives who took me in. Like many youths in their
                        area, I attended a pre-military academy called <a href="https://mechinathaemek.chivruta.org/"
                            class="outside-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                            'Emek HaMaayanot'</a> near
                        Beit She'an. There, we immersed ourselves in contemporary spiritual
                        philosophy and Zionism, and they prepared us physically and mentally
                        for military service. During my time at the academy, the IDF initially
                        refused to draft me due to a low medical profile. After attempting to
                        appeal the decision over several months and facing rejection from three
                        special committees, I opted to volunteer for national service. In the
                        first year, I served at <a href="https://jrv.org.il/" class="outside-link" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">'Jordan
                            River Village'</a>, and
                        in the second, with
                        <a href="https://www.mdais.org/en" class="outside-link" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Magen David
                            Adom</a> (MDA).
                    </p>
                    <p>After my service, I completed my matriculation exams and worked as
                        a paramedic. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, I, like many, found
                        myself with an abundance of free time. Eager to learn, I enrolled in
                        an online programming course. My interest piqued rapidly, and I delved
                        deep into the realms of programming and computing. Through a friend, I
                        learned about the Keren Or scholarship program for computer studies at
                        Reichman University. Seeing it as an excellent opportunity, I applied.
                        After successfully navigating the screening process, which included
                        mathematical and personality tests, I eagerly embarked on my academic
                        journey, feeling that all my efforts in the matriculation exams had
                        paid off.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, in my final year, I work at KoaliTime - which will help parents
                        monitor their children's usage of mobile apps, to ensure quality time
                        and usage of skill-building apps while using their devices.
                        I relish the challenges and critical thinking demanded by my courses.
                        I believe I've found my calling, a domain that consistently pushes and
                        nurtures my growth. Many facets of the high-tech world intrigue me,
                        and I aspire to work in a role that either adds value to the Health-Tech
                        sector or enhances the quality of life for many.
